# MAP IMAGES
> Thanks to Ocelot, Bacon, Mark, Syuks for providing images

Actual map images will be located in the [images](./images) folder.

Various formats of the images will be available in the [public](https://github.com/KZGlobalTeam/map-images/tree/public) branch (including the raw images)

## Usage

As stated above, the images you would likely use the [public](https://github.com/KZGlobalTeam/map-images/tree/public) branch of this repository.

That branch provides 2 JSON files (formatted and minified) consisting of all map links.

For example: https://github.com/KZGlobalTeam/map-images/raw/public/maps.min.json

You can also play with the URL to simply append the map name for the image: 

`https://github.com/KZGlobalTeam/map-images/raw/public/webp/thumb/bkz_apricity_v3.webp`
